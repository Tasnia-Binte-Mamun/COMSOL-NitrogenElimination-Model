# COMSOL-NitrogenElimination-Model

During deep sea diving, nitrogen dissolves into the bloodstream under high pressure and can form dangerous bubbles during decompression, causing conditions like decompression sickness. This study models the nitrogen transfer from the blood to the alveoli to estimate the nitrogen removal rate, which is crucial for diver safety. Doubling the breathing rate resulted in a 69% increase in nitrogen flow across the total lung alveolar surface, highlighting a potential way to reduce nitrogen-related health risks for divers.

A simple model is developed to study the process of diffusion of nitrogen from the blood stream to the alveolus through a thin layer of epithelial cells during deep sea diving. The problem is simplified by assuming that-

• The entire network of blood vessels can be modeled as a layer of blood stream flowing over a thin layer of epithelial cells in 2D. 

• The network of blood vessels fully covers the alveoli surface. The simplified geometry used for the model is shown. The nitrogen is removed from the blood stream through the 
layer of cells into the air in the alveolus.
