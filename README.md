# COMSOL-NitrogenElimination-Model

During deep sea diving, nitrogen dissolves into the bloodstream under high pressure and can form dangerous bubbles during decompression, causing conditions like decompression sickness. This study models the nitrogen transfer from the blood to the alveoli to estimate the nitrogen removal rate, which is crucial for diver safety. Doubling the breathing rate resulted in a 69% increase in nitrogen flow across the total lung alveolar surface, highlighting a potential way to reduce nitrogen-related health risks for divers.
